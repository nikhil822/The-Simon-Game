# The-Simon-Game

Made a memory based game using HTML, CSS and Javascript. An exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of flashing lights by pressing the colour pads in the correct order. In every level there will be a new random colour will appear out and you have to press that number as well as the previous coloured pads. 

For example: In level 1 Suppose the red colour blinks and you have to press that red colour. In level 2 the green colour blinks. To go to the next level you have to press first red colour and then green colour. In this way it goes on until and unless you press a wrong pad.
